# Intelligent Subtraction Tutor

### Introduction
This repository contains the code for the Intelligent Subtraction Tutor that I made as project in Artificial Intelligence course at my University. 

### Requirements

1. You'll need to deploy this project on a server, that supports Node.js and Python2.7 . If you have some server space

  (like on AWS), then you may skip this step, otherwise,

          SignUp for an account on www.modulus.io . Get your LOGIN and PASSWORD. 
          
          
2.Getting the Environment Ready:

(a). Install npm

          $ sudo apt-get install npm 

(b). Install node

          $ npm install node

(c). Installing Dependencies

          $ npm install body-parser
          $ npm install body-parser
          $ npm install request 
          $ npm install python-shell

(d). Keeping it clean

          $ mkdir intelligent-subtraction-tutor && cd intelligent-subtraction-tutor
          $ npm install -g modulus


3  Create a Facebook Page and App :
Here's the link to facebook's documentation explaining detailed steps to make an app and page ,

          https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/guides/quick-start
          
4 Create an account on https://wit.ai . Use the wit.ai API for the communication between wit.ai server and your server.

5 Train the bot according to your needs. 

Note : Both Facebook and wit.ai provide their API keys. The code above uses those api keys, which were generated from my account.
